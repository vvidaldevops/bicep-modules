# Bicep Modules with Azure Container Registry

## README
This document will be used to document the intent of the module and how to use it.

## xxxxx.bicep
Is where weâ€™ll place the Bicep code.

## Metadata

Versioning modules is a best practice as it helps with regressions and allows you to introduce breaking changes as modules evolve over time.
